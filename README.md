## How to make changes
1. create a new branch at newest (for most of time) point of master branch, the branch name should be a-b, where a = your name and b = the page or features your working on. For example, if i am working on homepage, the branch should be morry-HomeScreenUpdates.
2. make your update, which you can push as many time as you want on your own branch
3. when you finish your update, send a pull request to the master branch and assign me(flickon) as reviewer unless there are some other updates in master branch. In this case, you should merge master branch first and resolve the collision before you make any pull-request.
